 - You can choose any amount you desire to charge the customer at checkout, but it reflects on the customer's satisfaction and the amount of money they choose to pay. Also keeping them waiting for too long affects their satisfaction.![cashier](https://github.com/ssuyung/supermarket-game/assets/39045469/b776ec53-8e04-4c92-8f03-0612985fc632)
 - You have to make pizzas and ice cream yourself.
     - For pizzas, take a bag of flour to the bakery and put it on the table, then hold E/Enter to make dough. Then put the dough in the oven and hold E/Enter to bake the pizza. Finally put the pizza onto the counter outside the bakery.
     - For ice cream, simply stand in front of the ice cream freezer and hold E/Enter to produce ice cream.![ice cream](https://github.com/ssuyung/supermarket-game/assets/39045469/509ed0de-4e11-4b8b-9919-912e0aa1a9ee)
